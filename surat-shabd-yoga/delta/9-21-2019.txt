From Song Yutong
================

There is one lineage from Baba Somanath we would like to submit. Baba
Somanath built an Ashram in Bangalore, 1958, it was called Sawan
Durbar Ashram. And his successor is Baba Premanathji Maharaj (Sri
S.B.Pathrappa) (1919 to 1998). After Baba Premanathji Maharaj is
Dr. M.B. Vasudevachari (1954 to present). We had visited that Ashram
and met Dr. M.B. Vasudevachari. Itâ€™s very beautiful and pure
Ashram. Here is the website link http://sdakengeri.org/
