Thus Sayeth Patrick:

After, or at the same time as mailing your Puerto Rico/Notifications of Record mailings, you can do the following 
“Bailor Trust” UCC-1 filing, which is different than the previous UCC-1 filing that you have already done.

Attached is your “Bailor Trust Notice, Another UCC-1 Filing”, in the same UCC-1 Region state that your original UCC-1 
that we filed together is at.

It is another layer of protection for you, and is explained in our courses, and on the visual examples, attached.  
It is only 3 pages.

Just fill out as per the visual example.

1.       Date and sign the bottom of the UCC-1 form (unless doing online in Colorado, 
in which case we should also do this step together)

2.       Fill out the info on the blank lines on the last page that is another CAD page, 
but some it is slightly different (so don’t think it’s the same as the previous CAD page posted on the first ucc-1). 
You will write the same Certified Mail numbers from your last mailing, just like last time. 
Just hand-write these in is OK, or you can try to type them in if you know how to. 
Just ensure (triple check) that the certified mail numbers are all correct!!!  
That’s it! This is a very simple step. Don’t overcomplicate it.  
Once you are done contact me for the next step/s.
