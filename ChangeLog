	* Added data from Yong Sutong:
	There is one lineage from Baba Somanath we would like to
	submit. Baba Somanath built an Ashram in Bangalore, 1958, it was
	called Sawan Durbar Ashram. And his successor is Baba Premanathji
	Maharaj (Sri S.B.Pathrappa) (1919 to 1998). After Baba Premanathji
	Maharaj is Dr. M.B. Vasudevachari (1954 to present). We had
	visited that Ashram and met Dr. M.B. Vasudevachari. Itâ€™s very
	beautiful and pure Ashram. Here is the website link

	* Began reading "Anurag Sagar" by Kabir (graciously translated by
	Sant Ajaib Singh). The introduction points to several initiates of
	Kabir, who are now
	added. http://wayofmystics.webs.com/anuragsagar.htm
	* Cleanup the the Tarn Taran Lineage based on a post by David
	C. Lane

	* added (Sher Gill)[http://amzn.to/nXjW2L] thanks to a post from
	David C. Lane.
	* re-listed [Christopher Tims](http://www.christophertims.com/) as
	being derived from Harold Klemp since he was a teacher in the
	organization during that period.
	* contemplated renaming this list from a Sant Mat list to
	LightSong or something more inclusive. Sant Mat is a particular
	form of Inner Light and Sound practice.

	* Found the [Sant Nirankari
	Mission](http://www.nirankari.org/modules/idology/realisationoftruth/)
	via
	[Novelguide](http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/ear_01/ear_01_00174.html). Nirankar
	means formless. Their lineage traces back to Jaimal Singh.

	* [A discussion on Radhasoami Studies](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/radhasoamistudies/message/186591) has led to a general consensus that Darshan
	Singh "succeeded" Kirpal Singh. The word succeeded is in quoted
	because (1) Sant Thakar Singh certainly took over the ashrma.
	(2) It's not clear what documents the successorship.

	But more than anything, this lineage chart is about who proceeded
	from who (via initiation/study) and	steers clear of the idea of
	authentic sucessorship. This chart is primarily designed to list
	active available Inner Light and Sound paths and give a general
	idea of the teacher/master's background. It is
	not the purpose of this chart to make a statement about the
	sensitive and controversial topic of successorship. As long as a
	master has the goods and his students are pleased, then the person
	is listed as accurately as possible.

	* I just realized that Darshan Singh should not be listed as a
	successor of Kirpal Singh because he was initiated by Sawan
	Singh. I've updated the mind map, but will not push out the update
	to the map until next month or so.

	* index.html: added link to [the original sant mat guru lineage
	chart](http://replay.web.archive.org/20090413090150/http://www.santmat-meditation.net/guru/chart.html)
	and since she acknowledges David Lane, I think it is upon me to do
	the same.

	* the santmat.livingcosmos.org website is now it's own [source
	code repository](https://github.com/metaperl/santmat) instead of
	being lumped in with the metaphysics repository

2011-04-21    <thequietcenter@JCL4EVER>

	* moved location of Harinandan Baba based on information I saw in
	a [Pravesh K. Singh
	post](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/message/889)
	* added comment of Pravesh K. Singh about many ancient gurus (many
	of whom are not listed in my lineage charts)
	* added [realm chart of Aman
	Sandhu](http://wayofmystics.webs.com/thepath.htm)
	* added Babuji Maharaj as a successor of Brahm Mishra, per
	conversation with Michael Turner
	* added [Madhu Paramhans Ji](http://www.sahibbandgi.org/), per
	[message from robert
	s](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/message/876). Adding
	him led to Kabir being listed as a distinct root lineage rather
	than being lumped in with Shabda misc
	* Began to wonder if Supreme Master Ching Hai was initiated by
	Sant Thakar Singh and whether Paul Twitchell was initiated by
	Kirpal Singh. Not making any changes based on these speculations.
	* Added Sant Ram Singh Ji as initiate of Baba Somanath
	* Linked to [Radhasoami Studies discussion
	group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/radhasoamistudies/)

	* index.html:
	- Tulsi Sahib is now a primary branch of the lineage tree.
	- Radhasoami has always been a primary branch, but the various
	sub-groups (dinod, dayalbagh, beas, agra, etc) are now explictly
	listed. Discoverd a new lineage under Rai Salig Ram includes Shiv
	Brat Lal, Tara 	Chand, and Param Sant Kanwar
	(http://www.radhaswamidinod.org/)

	- new bibliographic reference -
	http://www.ex-premie.org/papers/lineage1.htm

	- scouring this leads to the addition of Shri Hans Ji
	Maharaj in the Shabd misc primary branch

	- Received 3 highly valuable emails from Tony Mohorovic. Result:
	-- also added maharishi mehi disciples
	-- also added ishwari puri (initiated by sawan singh at age 9!)
	(thanks Tony)
