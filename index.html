      <p>There are many ancient masters of this path not listed. The
	primary focus of this lineage chart is to help those actively
	seeing a guru/system/path. A number of the ancient masters were
	acknowledged by Pravesh K. Singh
	in <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/message/889">a

      <h3>Version 4</h3>

      <P>
	Farewell <a href="http://freemind.sf.net">FreeMind</a>,
	hello <a href="http://freeplane.sf.net">Freeplane</a>. Freeplane
	is the new version of freemind. The data file format is compatible
	between the two programs. You are welcome to 
	obtain <a href="http://www.github.com/metaperl/metaphysics">the
	  source</a> and create your own version. Or submit corrections
	to me (there has been some mention of inaccuracies). 
      </P>
      <P>
	There has
	been a request for dates to be listed. I have started adding that
	in the notes section of the gurus.
      </P>

      <h3>Version 3</h3>

      This version was done using <a href=
				     "http://freemind.sf.net">FreeMind</a>. This was the first version where the entire family of sant mat groups is on a single mind map.

      <h3>Version 2</h3>

      This version was done using <a href=
				     "http://www.mind42.com">Mind 42</a>.
      In this version, the lineage data was broken down into several mindmaps,
      each containing a major lineage.

      <div class="info">

          <dt><a href=

              Shiv Dayal Singh</a></dt>

          <dd>The father of the modern Shabad movement, called Sant
            Mat</dd>

          <dt><a href=
		 "http://www.mind42.com/pub/mindmap?mid=5e2ae901-31b2-4962-9f38-89b1339a5699">
              Bhagat Thind Singh</a></dt>

          <dd>He fought a number of social battles as well as writing
            a number of Shabad texts. Survived by some very good
            teachers.</dd>

          <dt><a href=
		 "http://www.mind42.com/pub/mindmap?mid=44dcbd21-40a5-43cb-b1eb-78f21aee6256">
              Rebazar Tarzs</a></dt>

          <dd>This lineage really has two sources. Paul Twitchell
            almost certainly was initiated by Kirpal Singh. However,
            Twitchell denies this and claims to have received the Rod
            of ECK from Rebazar Tarzs, an individual born in the year
            1461, in the mountain village of Sarana in northern Tibet.
            He looks to be in his middle thirties but is thought to be
            over 500 years old in his physical body.</dd>

          <li><a href="http://3108.info/">W.C. Vetsch</a> is a
            superman when it comes to melding Eastern and Western
            viewpoints on Sant Mat and related fields such as
            conspiracy theory, hard logic, high magick, math,
            gnosticism and fringe science. His <a href=
						  "http://3108.info/eom/EOM.pdf">Essentials of Mysticism</a>
            is a master work. He's the only person whose grasp of the
            inner and outer is strong enough to remind me of Maximilian
            Sandor (aka Joachim Steingrubner).</li>

            will find Michael Turner, the hippest hippie Sant Mat guru
            on Planet Earth. Who else is pro-marijuana and meat-eating
            in the Sant Mat community? Oh me... puff, puff, chomp,
            chomp (grin).
	    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/">Sant
	    Santati</a> is also an excellent group with very uptone

          <li><a href="http://soundcurrentrider.com">Sound Current
              Rider</a> is a site crafted with vision. This site was made

            looking at it and return to the inner (grin).</li>
