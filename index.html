      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  These maps are done using the excellent
	  <a href="http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/">Freeplane</a>
	  mind-mapping software. You are welcome to obtain
	  <a href="https://github.com/metaperl/santmat">the source</a>
	  and create your own version. Or submit corrections
	  to <a href="mailto:TheQuietCenter@gmail.com">me</a> (there
	  has been some mention of inaccuracies).
	</li>
        <li>
          Notes from the mindmap will now link to
          <a href="https://github.com/metaperl/santmat/wiki">
            the wiki.
          </a>
        </li>
	<li>
	  There has been a request for dates to be listed. I have
	  started adding that in the notes section of the gurus.
	</li>
	<li>
	  There are many ancient masters of this path not listed. The
	  primary focus of this lineage chart is to help those actively
	  seeking a guru/system/path. A number of the ancient masters
	  were acknowledged by Pravesh K. Singh
	  in <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/message/889">a
	    post of his</a>.

	  <h3>Version 3</h3>

	  This version was done using <a href=
					 "http://freemind.sf.net">FreeMind</a>. This
	  was the first version where the
	  entire family of sant mat
	  groups is on a single mind map.

	  <h3>Version 2</h3>

	  This version was done using <a href=
					 "http://www.mind42.com">Mind
	    42</a>.  In this version, the
	  lineage data was broken down
	  into several mindmaps, each
	  containing a major lineage.

		  Shiv Dayal Singh</a></dt>

              <dd>The father of the modern Shabad movement, called Sant
		Mat</dd>

		     "http://www.mind42.com/pub/mindmap?mid=5e2ae901-31b2-4962-9f38-89b1339a5699">
		  Bhagat Thind Singh</a></dt>

              <dd>He fought a number of social battles as well as
		writing a number of Shabad texts. Survived by some very
		good teachers.</dd>

              <dt><a href=

		  Rebazar Tarzs</a></dt>

              <dd>This lineage really has two sources. Paul Twitchell
		almost certainly was initiated by Kirpal Singh. However,
		Twitchell denies this and claims to have received the
		Rod of ECK from Rebazar Tarzs, an individual born in the
		year 1461, in the mountain village of Sarana in northern
		Tibet.  He looks to be in his middle thirties but is
		thought to be over 500 years old in his physical
		body.</dd>

	      I did this version using

	      tried hard to keep it around but things rise and they fall

	    <p>
	      Version 0 of this mindmap was done by a lady who ran the

	  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/">Sant
